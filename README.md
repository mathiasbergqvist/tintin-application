# Tintin Applications

## Introduction
Example applications build as a support application for my presentation "Tips & Trix med npm scripts" in preparation for the business conference "OpKoKo" in Cape Town, South Africe 2017.

## Purpose
The purpose for this project was to build an example application using React and the Redux pattern to show of the power of npm scripts and what things can be done with them. The branches are numbered 1-6 and surves the purpose of how to gradually expand the complexity of the npm scripts.

## Version
The current version is `1.0.0`.

## Installation
The user needs to have the package manager NPM installed in order to run the application. To start the application, navigate to the root folder of the project and run:
- `npm run server` (or `yarn server`) to start the server at [http://localhost:3031/]([http://localhost:3031/]).
- `npm run start` (or `yarn start`) to start the application at [http://localhost:3000/]([http://localhost:3000/]).

## User Guide
The application itself is lists different volumes of the comic book series "The Adventures of Tinin". Users can view detailed information about each novel and like and/or comment on it.

## Implementation
The application is created using the `create-react-app` cli and is based on `React` and the `Redux` state management pattern. The test are written in `Jest` and the server is created using `json-server`.
